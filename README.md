A lightweight web-application designed to track users steps, jumps and movement and thus calculate calories.

This web-application utilizes the benefits of :
- Threejs along with react using React-3-Fiber,
- ChartJs for visualizing exercise scores w.r.t time,
- MongoDB for scalable, highly available and flexible schema.

Do checkout the *Frontend* branch for the frontend implementation and the *backend* branch for the backend implementation.

This main branch tracks the progress of models, obstacles and other miscellaneous 3D artifacts used in this web-application
